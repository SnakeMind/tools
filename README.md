# tools
Tools I use (mostly in Kali), to make my life a bit easier.
Nowadays I will also add my non-kali scripts here.

##### after-install.sh
This script is solely for a freshly installed Kali VM.
Just to get the basis install rolling. No customizations yet, just getting an up to date install with the basic set of tools.
